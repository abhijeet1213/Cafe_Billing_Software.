members may choose from a pre-defined menu of fixed-price goods. This function helps
prevent frequent problems related to manual entry and guarantees price uniformity.
Real-time order tracking is one of the software's essential features. The software refreshes
in real time as orders are placed, giving users the most recent view of all active orders. By
lowering wait times and guaranteeing that orders are handled properly and quickly, this
feature not only improves the overall customer experience but also aids in better managing
busy times.
Apart from tracking in real-time, the software also includes automatic tax computation,
which makes staff billing easier and guarantees local tax laws are followed. Because this
technology eliminates the need for manual tax computations, there is less chance of error
and clients will be charged accurately.
Another essential component of the Simple Cafe Billing Software is the creation of receipts.
After an order is placed, the software may provide a comprehensive receipt that lists every
item that was ordered, the total price owed, and any taxes that may apply. In addition to
giving the consumer a clear record, this also enables the café to keep correct sales records.
A strong database that controls menu items, pricing, and sales records underpins the
software's backend. When necessary, it is simple to update menu items and pricing using
this database, which also guarantees data integrity. The database also makes it easier to
generate several reports that are necessary for corporate research and decision-making,
such daily sales summaries and inventory consumption.
The Simple Cafe Billing Software lays the groundwork for future improvements beyond

6. Technology overview
The technologies PHP/MYSQL, AJAX, JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON were chosen for the
Café BDU Billing System implementation. The program XAMP is used to create and
access databases. An HTTP server called Apache is in use. The work was carried out with
Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 in a "windows" environment.

6.1. PHP
PHP is a versatile programming language that works particularly well for server-side web
development, in which a web server is often used to run PHP scripts. The HTML source
document has PHP code inserted in it. The PHP runtime runs any PHP code found in a
requested file, primarily to produce dynamic content for web pages. Additionally, clientside GUI apps and command-line scripts may utilize it. The PHP Group makes it available
without charge, and users are allowed to construct, alter, and expand upon it for their own
purposes.

6.2. MySQL
Based on Structured Query Language (SQL), MySQL is an Open-Source Relational
Database Management System (RDBMS) supported by Oracle. Almost any operating
system, including Windows, Linux, and UNIX, can run MySQL. MySQL is most
frequently linked to web applications and online publication, despite its broad range of
uses. An essential part of the LAMP open-source corporate stack is MySQL. Using Linux
as the operating system, Apache as the web server, MySQL as the relational database
management system, and PHP as the object-oriented programming language, LAMP is a
platform for web development.

6.3.Apache
One web server software that is well-known for its part in the early development of the
WWW is the Apache HTTP Server. It achieved the distinction of being the first web server
software to cross 100 million webpages in 2009. Under the direction of the Apache
Software Foundation, an open community of developers develops and maintains Apache.

6.4. XAMPP
XAMPP is a lightweight, compact Apache distribution that comes with the most popular
web development tools all in one package. Students creating and testing PHP and MySQL
applications will find it to be the perfect tool due to its compact size, lightweight, and
mobility. There are two distinct packages available for free download: full and light, which
contain XAMPP. The complete package download offers a multitude of development tools,
however XAMPP Lite comes with the technologies required to achieve the criteria of the
Ontario Skills Competition. PHP, MySQL, phpMyAdmin, Open SQL, SQLite, and Apache
HTTP Server are all included in the compact package known as the lite version.

6.4.1. Installation of XAMPP control panel:
6.4.2. Creating Database
After testing and launching Apache and PHP, the next step is to launch MySQL and create
a database and table that will contain the data that our website will need. Go to the XAMPP
directory and execute the mysql_start.bat batch file to launch MySQL. phpMyAdmin is an
application included in the XAMPP package that lets developers manage and maintain
MySQL databases.
In order to build a database and table and add test data, we will be utilizing phpMyAdmin.
Make sure Apache and MySQL are up and running before testing phpMyAdmin by opening
the corresponding batch files, apache_start.bat and mysql_start.bat. In the background,
Apache and MySQL are operating, and we open our web browser and input
http://localhost/phpMyAdmin/. Should everything go well, we'll get a phpMyAdmin start
page similar to the one below. The first thing to do when phpMyAdmin is launched is to
create a new database.

6.5. Ajax
Ajax is a collection of web development methods that enable the creation of asynchronous
online applications by utilizing a variety of client-side web technologies. Web applications
may transmit and retrieve data asynchronously from a server using Ajax, all without
affecting the way the page looks and functions.
It's a method for building dynamic, quick websites. By secretly sharing tiny quantities of
data with the server, AJAX enables web pages to be updated asynchronously. This implies
that portions of a web page can be updated without requiring a page reload.

6.6.jQuery
A feature-rich, compact, and speedy JavaScript library is called jQuery. A JavaScript
library called jQuery was created to make HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation,
event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax easier. jQuery is designed to make using
JavaScript on your website more simpler.

6.7.JSON
Based on JavaScript object syntax, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a common textbased format for expressing structured data. In online applications, it is frequently utilized
for data transmission. It is an open standard file format and data exchange format that stores
and transmits data objects made up of arrays and attribute-value pairs using language that
is understandable by humans.


7. Project Description
Introduction:
Various cafés may easily manage records of their workers, food, merchandise, sales, etc.
by using the Café BDU Billing System. Using a manual approach makes it challenging to
accomplish this goal since the data is dispersed, often duplicated, and may take a long time
to gather. This project provides solutions for each of these issues.


7.2. Non-functional requirement
7.2.1. Needs for Performance
The suggested system that we will create will serve as the primary performance system that
assists the business in overseeing the café's whole database. Consequently, it is anticipated
that the database will fulfill all of the criteria in a functioning manner.

7.2.2. Security Conditions
Our plan is to create a database that is secure. Users fall into two categories: administrators
and staff, who can see all or just some of the database's contents. The access permissions
of users are determined based on their respective categories.


8. Conclusion & Future scope
❖ In summary
Customer happiness, accuracy, and operational efficiency are all greatly improved by the
café billing software. Through the automation of invoicing, inventory management, and
thorough reporting, the system minimizes mistakes and optimizes workflows. Better
resource management and financial tracking are the outcomes of this.
